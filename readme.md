## Description

This project is about how to improve accessibility on the client website. As a pretending junior developer I was working on existing code and needed to refactor it to meet a certain set of standards. Main goals of refactoring are:
- better positioning in search engines like Google
- ensure that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.
